      <h2>Pattern</h2>
      <p>This is the regex that will be used to determine whether a page should be sent to Choosy. If you need to specify multiple patterns, enclose each in parentheses and separate them with a `|` character. Remember to escape characters that have special meanings within a regex, like `.`, with backslashes.</p>
      <p>❗️ Be very careful not to save a pattern that matches any URL Choosy is configured to open in this browser-- that would create an infinite loop.</p>
